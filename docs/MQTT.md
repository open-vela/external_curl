# MQTT in curl

## Usage

A plain "GET" subscribes to the topic and prints all published messages.
Doing a "POST" publishes the post data to the topic and exits.

Example subscribe:

    curl mqtt://host/home/bedroom/temp

Example publish:

    curl -d 75 mqtt://host/home/bedroom/dimmer

## What does curl deliver as a response to a subscribe

It outputs two bytes topic length (MSB | LSB), the topic followed by the
payload.

## Caveats

Remaining limitations:
 - No username support
 - Only QoS level 0 is implemented for publish
 - No way to set retain flag for publish
 - No username/password support
 - No TLS (mqtts) support
 - Naive EAGAIN handling won't handle split messages

## Work

1. Write a mqtt server for the test suite
2. Create a few tests verifying the existing mqtt functionality
3. Work on fixing some of the worst limitations - with accompanying tests
4. Consider replacing the client-side MQTT code with wolfMQTT

## Credits

The initial MQTT patch was authored by Bj√∂rn Stenberg. This work is built upon
that patch and has been expanded since.
